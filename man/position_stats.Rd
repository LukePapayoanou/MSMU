\title{Computes Position Statics, Quintiles and Quartiles}
\usage{
position_stats(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{quint}{Numeric vector of quintiles (0\%, 20\%, 40\%, ..., 100\%)}
\item{quart}{Numeric vector of quartiles (0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 100\%)}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the quintiles, including quartiles(data is split in 4 equal parts)
and quintiles(data is split in 5 equal parts) of a numeric vector using the
'quantile()' function. NA's are removed.
}
\details{
\strong{Percentiles} are values that divide a dataset into 100 equal parts, each representing 1\% of the distribution.
For example, the 25th percentile is the value below which 25\% of the data fall.

\strong{Quartiles} are special percentiles that divide the data into four equal groups:
Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (50th percentile or median), Q3 (75th percentile).

\strong{Quintiles} divide data into five equal groups, each representing 20\% of the distribution:
20th percentile, 40th, 60th, 80th percentiles split the data into quintiles.
